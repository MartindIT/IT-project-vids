<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- VMware Workstation Pro (Virtual Machines/Compute)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

<h2>Overview</h2>




**I made a video on my project so that it will be easier to understand the steps I've done to use a VM with VMware.**

I noticed how hard it is to read and follow long projects so it'll just be easier this way ,Ive done this same exact project but within Microsoft Azure VMs. 

This is just an Updated/ Video format of my steps ive taken but within VMware.
